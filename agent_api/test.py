To create a file that prints "Hello, world," you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
2. Create a new file and save it with a .py extension.
3. In the file, type the following line of code: 

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

4. Save the file.
5. Open a terminal or command prompt.
6. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
7. Run the Python file by entering the following command:

```bash
python your_file_name.py
```

Replace `your_file_name` with the actual name you gave the file.
8. The output "Hello, world!" will be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.

That's it! You have created a file that prints "Hello, world!" in Python.
